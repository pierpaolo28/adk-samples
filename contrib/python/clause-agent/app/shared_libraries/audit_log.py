"""Append-only audit log for corrections and Legal-review resolutions.

PRD guardrail (§8): "Every correction is logged with who made it and when,
even though it's applied immediately -- so it stays auditable." This module
is intentionally separate from Memory Bank: Memory Bank stores the *current*
facts/rules an agent should retrieve, while the audit log stores the
immutable *history* of who changed what and why, for compliance review.
