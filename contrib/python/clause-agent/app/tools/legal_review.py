"""Legal Review tool: blocking human-in-the-loop gate for precedence rulings.

Wrapped as a `LongRunningFunctionTool` in
`app/sub_agents/hierarchy_resolver.py`
(`google.adk.tools.long_running_tool.LongRunningFunctionTool`). Per ADK's
HITL pattern for long-running tools:

  1. `request_legal_review` runs synchronously and returns immediately with
     a "pending" status -- the model's turn ends there and it tells the
     user it's waiting.
  2. Later, a human resolves the task out-of-band (here: via
     `resolve_legal_review`, called by `scripts/legal_review_cli.py` or a
     test harness). That does NOT call back into the agent by itself.
  3. The host application or runner (see `tests/test_end_to_end_trace.py`)
     is responsible for noticing the pending long-running call, and -- once
     `resolve_legal_review` has recorded a decision -- sending a new
     `types.Content` containing a `function_response` for that same call
     id back through `Runner.run_async(...)` to resume the paused turn.

This module only implements steps 1 and 2 (the tool + the local queue); step
3 is host/runtime plumbing, kept separate so it's testable without a real
LLM.
