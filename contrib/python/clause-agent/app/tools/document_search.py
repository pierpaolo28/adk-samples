"""Document Search tool: RAG-style retrieval over the contract corpus.

POC scope (PRD §5): a real document-ingestion pipeline is explicitly out of
scope. This module loads a small, structured JSON corpus (see
`app/data/contracts/corpus.json`) and does keyword/tag matching
instead of embeddings -- enough to prove the hierarchy-resolution and
citation logic without building a production RAG pipeline.

Design note (mirrors the PRD "Simulated Session" trace closely): each
section carries its own `doc_type` ("body" | "amendment" | "renewal" |
"exhibit" | "appendix"). `search_documents` defaults to the main written
pages only (`body`, `amendment`, `renewal`) -- callers must explicitly widen
`scope` to include `exhibit`/`appendix` to search attachments. This is not
an accident: TC3 in the PRD depends on the default search missing an
exhibit-only fact, so a downstream correction can teach the agent (via
Memory Bank) to widen its scope for that field going forward.

that has nothing to do with customer IDs. Requiring >= 2 overlapping
tokens means a real match needs either a tag hit (tags are curated to be
specific, e.g. "customer_id" contributes 2 tokens) or genuine multi-word
