"""Correction tool: structured intake for downstream (Billing) corrections.

Unlike a Legal-review ruling, a correction is *not* blocking (PRD glossary:
"Non-blocking correction (Business loop) -- a human corrects the agent's
answer after the fact. The agent doesn't need to stop and wait -- it just
accepts the fix and remembers it going forward."). It is applied
immediately, but always logged for auditability (PRD §8).

    Call this whenever a Billing/AR analyst tells you an answer was wrong,
    *before* writing the corrected fact (and any generalizable rule) to
    Memory Bank via `memory_bank_create`. This keeps every correction
    traceable to who reported it and why, even though the fix is applied
    immediately without escalation.

    Args:
      field: The field that was wrong, e.g. "customer_id" or
        "payment_term".
      customer: Customer/company the correction applies to.
      wrong_answer: What the agent originally answered.
      correct_value: The correct value, per the human's verification.
      correct_source: Where the correct value actually lives, e.g.
        "2018 contract, Exhibit A".
      root_cause: Why the agent got it wrong, e.g. "search scope excluded
        exhibits".
      reported_by: Identity of the person reporting the correction.
      proposed_rule: An optional reusable rule to generalize the fix beyond
        this one customer, e.g. "Always include exhibits/appendices in
        document search scope for customer ID lookups."
