"""Memory Bank tool: scoped, structured long-term memory for ClauseIQ.

The PRD's "Simulated Session" trace calls `memory_bank_search`/
`memory_bank_create` with hierarchical scope strings, e.g.
`"customer:AcmeCorp/product:ProductX/clause:payment_term"` or
`"global/rule:document_search_scope"`. We represent that scope as a plain
`dict[str, str]` (e.g. `{"customer": "AcmeCorp", "product": "ProductX",
"clause": "payment_term"}`) -- this maps directly onto Vertex AI Memory
Bank's structured `scope` parameter, so swapping `LocalJsonMemoryBankBackend`
for a real `VertexMemoryBankBackend` later requires no agent/tool changes,
only a different `MemoryBankBackend` implementation (see `set_backend`).

Guardrail (PRD §8): a scope that includes a "clause" key represents a
precedence/interpretation *ruling*, which must never be written without
Legal approval. `memory_bank_create` enforces this structurally (not just
via prompt instructions): it refuses the write unless both `approved_by` and
`approved_at` are provided.
