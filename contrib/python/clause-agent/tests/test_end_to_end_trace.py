"""Integration test reproducing the PRD's "Simulated Session" trace.

This drives the REAL agent tree (root_agent -> hierarchy_resolver /
clause_extractor) through a `ScriptedModel` (see `tests/fakes.py`) so only
the LLM's *decisions* (which tool to call, with what args, and what to say)
are scripted -- every tool actually executes for real: `search_documents`
hits the real corpus, `memory_bank_search`/`memory_bank_create` hit the real
(tmp-path-isolated) local backend, `submit_correction` writes to the real
audit log, and `request_legal_review`'s pending/resume cycle goes through
the real `Runner` resumption mechanism (verified directly against
`google-adk`'s source: `Runner._resolve_invocation_id` matches an incoming
`function_response`'s id against a prior `function_call` event in session
history -- this is a generic Runner mechanism, not something reimplemented
here).

Covers PRD TC1 (precedence conflict + Legal loop) and TC3 (not-found +
correction + cross-customer rule generalization), matching Act 1 / Act 2 of
the PRD's trace turn-by-turn.
