"""Check a google/adk-samples recipe against the house rules in .github/review-rules.md.

    check_house_rules.py --repo-root /path/to/checkout --recipe contrib/python/foo
    check_house_rules.py --repo-root . --recipe contrib/python/foo --json

Emits findings in the same schema the analysis lanes use, with `rule`, `ci` and
`anchorable` pre-populated. Deterministic: no model, no judgement, no tokens.

Every reportable rule in `.github/review-rules.md` is either implemented here or
declared in MODEL_JUDGED below, and `tests/test_house_rules_drift.py` fails if a
rule is in neither. That test is why this list is short: seven reportable rules
(H39-H47) were in the doc, unimplemented, and NOT on any declared exception list,
so nothing was checking them and nothing said so.

Three rules here have traps that a naive grep gets wrong, and each is called out at
its implementation:

    H9   `source = { editable = "." }` is the recipe's OWN package, not a violation
    H15  needs package-root resolution among many __init__.py, and is a NEGATIVE
    H19  needs the real JSON schema; `license`/`tags` ARE permitted keys
