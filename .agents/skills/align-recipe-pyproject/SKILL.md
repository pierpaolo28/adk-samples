  Aligns a Python recipe's pyproject.toml with the repo's standards enforced

  ruff.toml / .ruff.toml files (also forbidden in recipes) are caught by the

  --dry-run that reports what needs alignment, and an apply mode that
  rewrites pyproject.toml (and optionally manifest.yaml) using
  comment-preserving TOML/YAML editors. Use when the user wants to "align
  the recipe's pyproject.toml", "fix pyproject to match the repo standard",
  "check what needs changing in a recipe's pyproject", or clean up a recipe
  before submitting a PR.

# Align Recipe pyproject.toml

Use this skill to bring a Python recipe's `pyproject.toml` (and, when it disagrees, its `manifest.yaml` description) into conformance with the repo standard enforced by `.github/workflows/python-validate-recipe.yml`.

Scope: **`pyproject.toml` only**. Standalone `ruff.toml` / `.ruff.toml` files are also forbidden in recipes but are enforced by the CI workflow (Check 7 in `python-validate-recipe.yml`) — outside this skill's concern.

**Not in scope: `adk-major-current`.** The CI validator also emits a warn-only notice when a `core/` recipe resolves to an older `google-adk` major. This skill deliberately does not implement it, and you should not add it. The mechanical fix — widening `<2.0.0` to `<3.0.0` and re-locking — produces a recipe importing a major it was never ported to, and that break surfaces at runtime rather than in any check. Crossing an ADK major is a code migration; this skill only rewrites metadata. If you are asked to "fix the ADK notice", port the recipe by hand.

---

## What This Skill Checks

Runs `scripts/align_pyproject.py` against a recipe directory. Eight rules:

| Rule ID | What it checks | Auto-fix |
|---|---|---|
| `no-local-ruff-config` | Recipe `pyproject.toml` must not declare any `[tool.ruff*]` table. Ruff config is centralized in the root `pyproject.toml`. | Yes — removes the tables. |
| `python-version-floor` | `[project].requires-python` must **accept Python 3.11 exactly** — it must neither permit anything below (loose floors like `>=3.10`) nor exclude 3.11 by requiring higher (`>=3.12`, `~=3.12`, etc.). Per `AGENTS.md` "Minimum python version: 3.11" and CI in `.github/workflows/python-dependency-policy.yml`, which pins Python 3.11 and would otherwise emit a misleading "lockfile is out of date" error whose real cause is the interpreter mismatch. | Yes — rewrites the specifier so its lower bound is `>=3.11` while preserving every upper bound, exclusion, compatible-release (`~=`) ceiling, and pin (only pure `>=`/`>` are dropped or replaced). Applies to BOTH failure modes (loose floors AND higher-than-min floors). If the result would still exclude 3.11 (e.g. `>=3.10,!=3.11` → `>=3.11,!=3.11`, or `~=3.12` → `>=3.11,~=3.12` == `>=3.12,<4`), refuses to apply and returns `needs_input` for a human to resolve (typically: relax the ceiling, or raise the recipe with the maintainers to update CI's pinned interpreter). |
| `project-name-matches-folder` | `[project].name` must equal the recipe's required name: the folder basename under `core/`/`contrib/`, but `<vertical>-<solution>` under `plugins/`, whose mandatory vertical namespace (`plugins/<vertical>/<solution>`) makes the basename non-unique — `plugins/retail/product-search` and `plugins/grocery/product-search` would otherwise both claim `product-search`. | Yes — sets it. |
| `description-matches-manifest` | If `[project].description` is set, it must equal `manifest.description`. Field is optional; skipped when absent. | Only with `--description-source={pyproject,manifest,delete}`. Refuses to touch description otherwise. |
| `build-system-present` | `[build-system]` must have both `requires` and `build-backend`. Without it, `uv build` and `pip install .` fail. | **No** — backend choice is editorial. Reported for the human to fix. |
| `default-pypi-index` | `[[tool.uv.index]]` must have an entry with `default = true` pointing at public PyPI (`https://pypi.org/simple[/]`). Required so `uv sync` works on Google corp workstations without corp Airlock auth — see the block comment in the root `pyproject.toml` for the full rationale. | Yes when the block is entirely missing — appends it. **No** when a default entry exists but points elsewhere (custom private index, TestPyPI, mirror) — reported for the human to reconcile, since the divergence may be intentional. |
| `stale-python-version-refs` | Scans **every text file in the recipe** for references to a Python version below the 3.11 floor. Raising `requires-python` is not a self-contained edit: the version is typically repeated in prose (`README.md`, `SKILL.md`) and in executable setup code. | **No** — report-only. Which references are stale and how to reword them is editorial. |
| `runnability-test-in-testpaths` | If `[tool.pytest.ini_options].testpaths` is set, at least one entry must collect `tests/test_runnability.py` (which `.github/policy.yml` requires every Python recipe to have). | **No** — report-only. Broadening `testpaths` changes what CI collects. |

#### Why `stale-python-version-refs` exists

A bootstrap script that picks an interpreter from an allowlist still
containing the old floor will happily build a venv the recipe then refuses to
install into:

```bash
for py in python3.13 python3.12 python3.11 python3.10 python3; do
# ...
# ERROR: Package requires a different Python: 3.10.x not in '>=3.11'
```

The scan requires a Python-ish context (`python 3.10`, `Python :: 3.10`,
`>=3.10`) rather than matching bare digits, so a model name like
`gemini-3.5-flash` is not a false positive. It skips lockfiles, virtualenvs,
caches, and binary files, and ignores `requires-python` in `pyproject.toml`
itself (owned by `python-version-floor`, and still pre-rewrite in memory when
this check runs). Hits are capped at 40 in `details.hits`, but
`details.files` always lists every affected file.

### Edit safety

- TOML edits go through **`tomlkit`** — comments, blank lines, and unrelated tables in `pyproject.toml` are preserved.
- YAML edits (only when `--description-source=pyproject` overwrites `manifest.description`) go through **`ruamel.yaml`** — comments in `manifest.yaml` are preserved.
- Files are only rewritten if at least one auto-fix actually ran. Otherwise on-disk bytes are untouched.
- No files outside the recipe directory are ever modified. The workflow file, root `pyproject.toml`, and other recipes are safe.

---

## Rules for the Agent

1. **Always use the script — never hand-edit `pyproject.toml` or `manifest.yaml` to perform these changes.** The script exists specifically so edits are style-preserving and reviewable via one report.

2. **Ask for the recipe directory** if the user has not provided one. Do not guess. Recipe roots live under `core/python/<name>/`, `contrib/python/<name>/`, or `plugins/<vertical>/<solution>/`.

3. **Always start with `--dry-run`** unless the user has explicitly said "apply", "fix it", "just do it", or equivalent. Show them what would change before doing it.

4. **Only report checks that need attention.** The script always returns every check's status, but the user does not need to see the ones that passed. Filter to `status != "ok"`.
   - If **nothing** needs attention: reply with a single positive line (see the response format below). Don't list what's fine, don't build a table.
   - If **something** needs attention: render only the non-ok checks.

5. **If `description-matches-manifest` returns `needs_input`**, the descriptions in `pyproject.toml` and `manifest.yaml` disagree and the script cannot pick a winner. Present the two values side by side and ask the user to choose one of the three resolution options. Do not re-run the script until they choose.

6. **If `build-system-present` returns `report_only`**, `[build-system]` is missing or incomplete. Tell the user the recipe cannot be built as a package until this is fixed, and offer them a hatchling or `uv_build` template snippet. Do **not** silently pick one.

7. **If `default-pypi-index` returns `report_only`**, the recipe declares a default index that is NOT public PyPI (e.g. a private mirror, TestPyPI). The skill will not overwrite an intentional choice. Show the user the current `url` from `details.current_url` and ask whether it's deliberate. If yes, they can `# noqa`-comment it or update the repo standard; if no, they should change the URL to `https://pypi.org/simple/`. Do not auto-rewrite.

8. **If `stale-python-version-refs` returns `report_only`**, list the affected files from `details.files` and call out any **executable** ones first (`.sh`, `.py`, `Makefile`, CI YAML) — a stale interpreter allowlist in a bootstrap script is a live bug, not a docs nit, and it produces a confusing `requires a different Python` failure at install time. Prose files (`README.md`, `SKILL.md`) are lower priority but still inconsistent. Offer to update them; do not rewrite without asking, since some references are legitimately historical ("dropped 3.10 support in v2").

9. **If `runnability-test-in-testpaths` returns `report_only`**, the recipe's `testpaths` excludes `tests/test_runnability.py`, so a bare `uv run pytest` never runs it — the recipe looks tested while its import-smoke test silently never executes. Show `details.testpaths` and suggest adding `"tests"`. Do not auto-rewrite.

10. **After apply mode succeeds**, remind the user to run `uv sync` in the recipe directory if the pyproject changes touched dependencies (the script emits this in `notes` when relevant).

11. **Do not commit any changes.** Show the diff or file contents; let the user commit.

## Input

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--recipe-dir` | Yes | Path to the recipe root (e.g. `core/python/cross-session-memory`, `contrib/python/my-recipe`, `plugins/retail/store-ops`). |
| `--dry-run` | No | Report what would change without modifying any files. |
| `--description-source` | Only when resolving a `description-matches-manifest` mismatch. Values: `pyproject`, `manifest`, `delete`. See below. | Chooses how to reconcile a description mismatch. |

### `--description-source` semantics

| Value | Effect |
|---|---|
| `pyproject` | Overwrite `manifest.description` with the value from `[project].description`. Use when pyproject is authoritative (e.g. it was updated more recently). |
| `manifest` | Overwrite `[project].description` with the value from `manifest.description`. Use when the manifest is authoritative. |
| `delete` | Remove `[project].description` from `pyproject.toml` entirely, so `manifest.description` becomes the single source of truth. Use when the recipe doesn't need a wheel-metadata description. |

If the descriptions already match, this flag is ignored.

## Run

### Dry-run (read-only report — start here)

```bash
uv run --no-project --with tomlkit --with 'ruamel.yaml' --with packaging \
  python .agents/skills/align-recipe-pyproject/scripts/align_pyproject.py \
  --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR> --dry-run
```

Output: JSON on stdout. Every check produces one entry with `id`, `status` (`ok` / `would_fix` / `needs_input` / `report_only` / `error`), a human-readable `message`, and structured `details`. Exit code is always `0` in dry-run.

### Apply (rewrite files)

```bash
uv run --no-project --with tomlkit --with 'ruamel.yaml' --with packaging \
  python .agents/skills/align-recipe-pyproject/scripts/align_pyproject.py \
  --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR>
```

Fixes everything the script can safely fix. Exits `0` if nothing is left unresolved, `1` otherwise (typically because `description-matches-manifest` needs `--description-source` or `build-system-present` needs a human).

### Apply with description resolution

```bash
uv run --no-project --with tomlkit --with 'ruamel.yaml' --with packaging \
  python .agents/skills/align-recipe-pyproject/scripts/align_pyproject.py \
  --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR> --description-source={pyproject|manifest|delete}
```

### Preview a description resolution (dry-run + `--description-source`)

`--description-source` combines with `--dry-run`: the script reports the
`would_fix` outcome of the chosen resolution **without writing any files**.
Use this to show the user exactly what a given choice will do before you
apply it — the two flags are not mutually exclusive.

```bash
uv run --no-project --with tomlkit --with 'ruamel.yaml' --with packaging \
  python .agents/skills/align-recipe-pyproject/scripts/align_pyproject.py \
  --recipe-dir <RECIPE_DIR> --dry-run \
  --description-source={pyproject|manifest|delete}
```

## Respond

Filter the report to checks with `status != "ok"`. Never list what's fine — the user is here to see what needs doing.

### If everything passed

Reply with a single line, no table, no bullets. Something like:

> ✓ `<RECIPE_DIR>`'s pyproject.toml is fully aligned with the repo standard. No changes needed.

Then stop. Do not run any further tools.

### If there are things to report

Name the recipe directory once, then render **a single Markdown table** with these three columns:

| Rule | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|

- **Rule** — the check `id`, in backticks (e.g. `` `no-local-ruff-config` ``).
- **Status** — the raw status value (`would_fix`, `fixed`, `needs_input`, `report_only`, `error`). Do not add emoji unless the user has asked for them.
- **Details** — a compact summary of both what's wrong and what will happen (or what the user must do), merged into one cell so the table stays 3 columns wide. Quote `from` → `to` values from `details` when present.

Include exactly one row per non-ok check. Do not include `ok` rows.

Status-specific guidance for what to put in the **Details** cell:

- **`would_fix`** (dry-run) — describe the current-state problem, then say what apply would do. Include the `from` → `to` or the list of tables to be removed.
- **`fixed`** (apply) — one-liner confirming the change (new value or list of removed tables).
- **`needs_input`** (only `description-matches-manifest`) — the Details cell says something like `"descriptions differ — needs --description-source={pyproject,manifest,delete}"`. Do not put the two long descriptions inside the table. See "Follow-up content" below.
- **`report_only`** (four rules can hit this: `build-system-present`, `default-pypi-index` when a non-PyPI default is declared, `stale-python-version-refs`, and `runnability-test-in-testpaths`) — the Details cell names what's missing or non-conforming (e.g. `"[build-system] missing; recipe cannot be built as a package"` or `"default index is TestPyPI, not public PyPI"`). Follow-up content goes below the table (see next section).
- **`error`** — the Details cell shows the message verbatim; if it's very long, truncate with `…` and put the full text below.

### Follow-up content below the table

Only for statuses that need extra context. Order: table first, then this content, then closing action.

- **`needs_input` follow-up** — present `pyproject_description` and `manifest_description` from `details` side by side (a small nested table works well), then ask the user to pick one of `pyproject`, `manifest`, or `delete`. Do not re-run until they answer.
- **`report_only` follow-up** — explain the impact (recipe cannot be built as a package) and paste both templates so the user can choose:

  ```toml
  # Hatchling (traditional Python packaging)
  [build-system]
  requires = ["hatchling"]
  build-backend = "hatchling.build"

  [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
  packages = ["app"]

  # ---- OR ----

  # uv_build (Astral's uv-native backend)
  [build-system]
  requires = ["uv_build>=0.8.14,<0.9.0"]
  build-backend = "uv_build"

  [tool.uv.build-backend]
  module-root = ""
  module-name = "app"
  ```

- **`error` follow-up** — if the message was truncated in the table, print it verbatim in full below. Do not attempt to work around it.

### Closing action

- **Dry-run with at least one `would_fix` row** — **offer to apply the fixes yourself.** Do NOT paste the raw command as a copy-and-paste snippet for the user. Instead ask something like "Want me to apply these fixes?" (a yes/no question is fine; a question with clear options is nicer UX). If the user agrees, run apply mode yourself and render the result as another table (with `fixed` rows instead of `would_fix`). If the user declines, stop.

- **Dry-run with only `needs_input` for `description-matches-manifest`** — after the table, show the two descriptions side by side and ask the user to pick one of `pyproject`, `manifest`, or `delete`. When they choose, run apply yourself with `--description-source=<their choice>` and render the resulting table. Do not offer generic "apply" — the flag is required.

- **Dry-run with only `report_only`** (and no `would_fix` rows) — after the table, address the specific case:
  - `build-system-present`: show the two `[build-system]` template snippets and stop. This is a manual edit; the skill does not auto-fix it.
  - `default-pypi-index`: quote `details.current_url`, explain that this is not public PyPI, and ask whether it's intentional. If not, tell the user to change the URL to `https://pypi.org/simple/`. Do not auto-rewrite.
  - `stale-python-version-refs`: list `details.files`, executable files first, and offer to update them.
  - `runnability-test-in-testpaths`: quote `details.testpaths` and suggest adding `"tests"`.

- **Dry-run with only `error` rows** — do not offer to apply. Errors mean the script bailed before it could compute a fix; the user has to resolve the underlying issue first.

- **Dry-run with a mix** (e.g. some `would_fix` + a `needs_input`) — offer to apply the fixable ones. The apply run will fix those and leave the others as-is; render the resulting table and then address the remaining statuses per the rules above.

- **Apply mode with any `fixed` row** — end with the "Next steps" reminder (see below).

Do NOT commit any changes yourself. Ever.

### After apply mode

If any check has `status: fixed`, remind the user:

```
Next steps:
  cd <RECIPE_DIR> && uv sync    # if dependencies changed
  git diff                       # review the edits before committing
```

Then stop. Do not commit. Do not run any further tools. End your turn.
