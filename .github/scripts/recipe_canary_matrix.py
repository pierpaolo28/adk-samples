"""
Build the job matrix for .github/workflows/recipe-canary.yml.

Emits one entry per (recipe, python-version) pair the canary should exercise,
as a JSON array on stdout:

    [{"recipe": "core/python/deep-search", "python": "3.11"}, ...]

Why two Python versions per recipe
----------------------------------
`python-tests.yml` pins Python 3.11 and nothing else, so a recipe declaring
`requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.14"` has its claim to support 3.12 and 3.13
tested nowhere. That is not theoretical: `core/python/rag-agent-search`
advertises `<3.14` and cannot be imported on 3.13 at all — the google-genai
2.10.0 it pins ships a module with a misplaced `from __future__` import, a
hard SyntaxError. It passes cleanly on 3.11.

So the canary tests the floor AND the ceiling of what each recipe claims:
the version everyone actually uses, plus the highest one it promises to work
on. A recipe that only claims 3.11 gets a single job.

This is the rot the canary exists for. A frozen lockfile does not decay on
its own — the interpreter moves underneath it.

Scope
-----
Python recipes under core/, contrib/ and plugins/, discovered by manifest.yaml
declaring `language: python`. Recipes marked `status: inactive` are INCLUDED:
a recipe on the retirement path still needs to be noticed if it starts
passing again, and skipping it would make "fixed but never reactivated"
invisible until deletion.

Usage:
    python recipe_canary_matrix.py            # every recipe
    python recipe_canary_matrix.py --recipe core/python/deep-search
