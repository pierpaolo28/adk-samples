"""Pin the security properties of the agy-driven workflows.

These workflows run a model over input an anonymous contributor wrote — a
fork PR's diff, an issue body — on a runner that holds a Google Cloud
credential and, in one job, a token that can write to the repository. What
keeps that safe is a handful of small facts spread across these YAML files:
an empty tool allowlist, a job that cannot write, a job that cannot reach
the cloud.

Every one of those facts is a line someone can plausibly "fix" later for a
good-sounding local reason — a review that failed on a denied tool, a job
that would be simpler merged back into one. None of them is covered by
ruff, by actionlint, or by any test of the scripts themselves, so without
this file the entire remediation for b/555419958 can be undone silently and
every check stays green.

The assertions are deliberately about PROPERTIES, not about exact text, so
ordinary edits to these workflows do not trip them.
