"""Pin the four properties that make the house-rules lane safe.

It is the only AI-review workflow that checks out the pull request's own code.
That is a deliberate trade, and it holds only while all four of these are true:

  1. the job that sees PR code holds no secret and no write token
  2. nothing from the PR is executed, imported or installed
  3. the checker comes from the base checkout, not the PR's copy
  4. posting happens in a job that never saw the PR's code

Each is one edit away from being false, and none of them would fail loudly:
a workflow that adds `uv sync` in the wrong directory works perfectly right up
until someone points a hostile PR at it. So they are asserted here rather than
described in a comment nobody re-reads.
