"""Consistency tests for .github/dependabot.yml.

The repo opens no Dependabot PRs against recipes — neither version updates
nor security updates. Recipe owners own dependency freshness, the monthly
canary in recipe-canary.yml detects rot, and advisories stay visible as
alerts in the Security tab. The reasoning is in the header of dependabot.yml.

This has now inverted twice, so it is worth being precise about what the
tests guard today.

Originally the invariant was "every ecosystem in the tree has a config
entry", so a new Go or Java recipe failed loudly rather than silently going
unmanaged. When version updates were switched off (#2501) that flipped: the
*presence* of a recipe entry became the thing to catch, because it would
restart the flood the policy exists to stop.

Absence turned out to be too blunt. Removing the entries left the repo with
no way to say anything about an ecosystem at all — and security updates,
which ignore the question of whether an entry exists, kept opening PRs. One
advisory wave opened 13 in 34 minutes. Suppressing those needs `ignore`, and
`ignore` needs an entry to live in.

So the invariant is no longer about presence or absence. A recipe ecosystem
MUST appear, and MUST appear in the suppression shape: no version updates
(`open-pull-requests-limit: 0`) and no security updates (`ignore` of "*").
Both halves are load-bearing and each is checked, because dropping either
one quietly re-enables a flood the other does not cover.

What these tests cannot do is verify Dependabot's own behaviour. Whether
`ignore` really suppresses a grouped security update is only observable
after a merge to the default branch, on the next advisory.

    """The backstop for the mistake this policy keeps making.

    Coverage here has been wrong three times, each time the same way: the
    suppression list was written from a remembered set of ecosystems rather
    than a measured one. pip and docker were missed because no detector
    looks for requirements.txt or a Dockerfile. terraform was missed because
    nobody thinks of .tf as a dependency manifest. Each gap was invisible
    until someone went looking.

    So stop relying on going looking. This walks the actual tree, maps every
    manifest filename to its ecosystem, and fails if any of them has no
    entry in dependabot.yml. Adding a recipe in a new language now fails
    here instead of quietly opening PRs six months later.

    An entry is required even for an ecosystem that cannot currently raise
    an alert — terraform and pre-commit are absent from GitHub's
    dependency-graph supported-ecosystems table today, so neither can open
    a security PR. That list is GitHub's to change without telling anyone,
    and the cost of a redundant entry is eight lines.
