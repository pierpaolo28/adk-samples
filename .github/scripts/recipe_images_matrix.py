Decide which recipes get a container image built, and what to call it.

Answers one question: which recipe directories under the live roots carry a
Dockerfile at their root, and what image path should each one publish to?

Why this exists as its own module
---------------------------------
`.agents/skills/make-python-recipe-deployable` writes the serving files a
recipe needs — Dockerfile, fast_api_app.py, app_utils/ — and then stops. Its
own words: "Image builds happen later via Cloud Build → Artifact Registry;
this skill's job ends when the files are correct." This module is the front
half of that later step: it turns the tree into a build matrix.

Recipe-root Dockerfiles only
----------------------------
A recipe can contain more than one Dockerfile. contrib/python/multiformat-
hybrid-rag ships four — one for the recipe, three for data-ingestion
sub-services it stands up. Only the file at the recipe root serves the agent
and satisfies the Agent Engine container contract; the others are backing
infrastructure with their own lifecycles. Publishing those under a recipe
image name would misrepresent what the image is, so the walk stops at the
first Dockerfile it finds down each path.

A Dockerfile is not by itself evidence of a recipe
--------------------------------------------------
plugins/retail/virtual-tryon/assets/export-template carries one, and it is a
build asset shipped by a plugin rather than an agent anybody deploys. The
manifest is what makes a directory a recipe — the schema at
.github/schemas/manifest-schema.json is the same thing `deployable` is
declared in — so a root Dockerfile earns an image only when a manifest.yaml
sits beside it. Without that test the walk publishes whatever happens to be
containerized, and derives a nonsense language ("retail") from the path while
doing it.

Live roots only
---------------
SCAN_ROOTS and SKIP_DIRS are imported from recipe_manifests rather than
restated, because the retired roots (python/agents, java/agents, ... — see
`frozen_paths` in .github/policy.yml) still contain Dockerfiles. Those paths
are closed to new work; images built from them would be published from code
nobody is allowed to fix. Importing means this module cannot drift out of
agreement with the rest of the tooling about what "live" means.

Image naming: <language>/<recipe>, not <root>/<language>/<recipe>
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The root is deliberately dropped. A recipe promoted from contrib/ to core/ is
the same recipe, and its published image name should not change underneath
consumers who have pinned it. Language is kept because it disambiguates:
core/kotlin/llm-auditor and contrib/python/llm-auditor coexist today, and the
leaf name alone would collide.

Zero third-party dependencies, matching its callers.
