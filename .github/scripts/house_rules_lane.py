"""Run the deterministic house-rules checker over the recipes a PR touches.

Used by .github/workflows/ai-pr-review-house-rules.yml. This is the fifth
review lane and the only one with no model in it.

The other four lanes ask a model to judge repository conventions from prose
injected into its prompt, with no tools and no checkout. Most of those
conventions are not judgement calls at all -- a `[tool.ruff]` table either is
in the file or is not -- and a model that gets one wrong produces the single
most expensive comment this system can make: a confident, specific, false
"this will fail CI". `.agents/skills/github-pr-review/scripts/check_house_rules.py`
already decides those rules by reading the files, so this lane runs it and
turns its findings into the same shape the model lanes emit.

Two properties make that safe to run against a pull request's own code:

  NOTHING FROM THE PR IS EXECUTED.  The checker parses. It reads text, walks
  directories, calls tomllib and `ast.parse`, and runs `git ls-files`. It
  never imports, execs, or installs anything out of the tree under review, so
  a hostile recipe gets no more privilege than a hostile text file.

  THE CHECKER ITSELF COMES FROM THE BASE BRANCH.  --checker points at the base
  checkout, never at the PR's copy. Otherwise a PR could rewrite the script
  that reviews it, which is the same reason the workflow injects the rules
  from the base branch rather than the head.

Usage:
  python3 house_rules_lane.py \
    --checker <base>/.agents/skills/github-pr-review/scripts/check_house_rules.py \
    --repo-root <head checkout> \
    --changed-files changed.txt \
    --out findings.json

Exit codes:
  0  findings written (possibly an empty list)
  2  CI fault -- the checker could not be loaded or run
