Hold review requests until a pull request is ready for review.

"Ready" means no failing checks and no unresolved review threads opened by a
bot. Configured in .github/review-gate-config.yml. Invoked by
.github/workflows/review-gate.yml, either for one PR (a review was just
requested) or as a sweep over every open PR (on a schedule).

What it does
------------
For each PR it decides one of:

  bounce   A reviewer is requested but the PR is not ready. Remove the
           requested reviewers, remember who they were, label the PR, and
           post (or update) one comment listing what is wrong.
  release  The PR was bounced and is now ready. Re-request the remembered
           reviewers, drop the label, and update the comment.
  update   Still bounced, but the list of problems changed. Edit the comment.
  none     Anything else, including checks that are still running.

Running checks never cause a bounce. People request a review seconds after
pushing; bouncing on "not finished yet" would bounce nearly everyone.

State
-----
The gate's own PR comment is the source of truth. A hidden marker at the top
carries the reviewers it removed, so a release knows whom to put back. The
label only exists so humans can filter on it. Only a marker written by the
gate's own account (`GATE_LOGIN`) is trusted; anyone can paste
a marker into a comment.

Usage
-----
GITHUB_REPOSITORY must name the repository (Actions sets it; set it by hand
for a local run).

  python .github/scripts/review_gate.py --pr 123
  python .github/scripts/review_gate.py --sweep
  python .github/scripts/review_gate.py --sweep --dry-run

Requires: `gh` on PATH, GITHUB_TOKEN in the environment, PyYAML.
