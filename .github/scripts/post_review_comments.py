"""
Turn the AI PR reviewer's JSON findings into one GitHub review payload.

Used by .github/workflows/_ai-pr-review-core.yml. The reviewer agent used to
post its own comments through the GitHub MCP server, which took three chained
tool calls; the model kept getting that sequence wrong, retried, and re-sent
its whole context each time, so a single review burned ~1.4M input tokens
across ~80 round trips and then hit the wall clock. The agent now returns
findings as JSON and this script does the posting, which makes the reviewer a
single request/response.

Moving the posting here buys line validation as well. GitHub rejects an ENTIRE
review if one comment names a line outside the diff, and a model picking a
plausible-but-wrong line is routine. Anchors are recomputed from the same diff
the reviewer was shown, so a bad position is dropped on its own instead of
taking every other comment down with it.

It is also where the reviewer's output is checked rather than trusted. The
prompt's severity gate ("only critical or high") used to be the only thing
standing between a wrong finding and a contributor's PR, and it worked by
making the reviewer say almost nothing — across eight recent PRs the three
lanes posted one or two comments between them, all from Correctness. Trading
that gate for a wider one is only safe if something downstream can tell a real
finding from an invented one, so four checks live here:

  WINDOW      Each finding quotes the diff lines it sits on. Those are matched
              against the diff itself. No match means the finding was
              fabricated and it is dropped; a match a few lines off means the
              finding is real and only its arithmetic was wrong, so the anchor
              is corrected instead of the finding being lost.
  CHEAPNESS   A finding whose own stated verification procedure admits it
              needs a second file, or a traced value, or an assumed input,
              costs the author more to check than it is worth. Dropped.
  DUPLICATES  Anything already said on this PR — by an earlier run of this
              lane, by one of the other three, or by a human — is suppressed.
              Four lanes re-running on every push otherwise repeat themselves.
  CONTEXT     A verified finding on a line the PR does not add cannot be an
              inline comment, but it is still true. It goes in the review body
              rather than into the log where nobody reads it.

Usage:
  python3 post_review_comments.py \
    --result agy_result.json \
    --diff pr_diff_used.txt \
    --label Correctness \
    --out review_payload.json \
    [--repo owner/name --pr 123]

--repo/--pr enable duplicate suppression; without them the other three checks
still run. --out is written ONLY when there is something to post, so the caller
can treat "file absent" as "nothing to post".

Every failure here is a CI fault, never the contributor's: the reviewer agent
returned something unusable, or a file this workflow wrote is unreadable. None
of it is caused by, or fixable from, the pull request under review — so they go
through ci_message.infra_fault, which annotates this checker rather than the
contributor's code.

Exit codes:
  0  payload written, or nothing worth posting
  2  CI fault — the reviewer's output could not be read as findings

    The prompt asks for a bare fenced block and nothing else, but a stray
    sentence either side is the likeliest way for the model to drift, and
    re-prompting costs another full model call.

    The inside of the block drifts too: a reviewer answered PR #2547 with
    "[]\\n[]" — two arrays in one fence — which is not a JSON document, so
    parsing the block as one value failed the run as a CI fault over a review
    that had simply found nothing. Each top-level array is decoded in turn and
    their findings concatenated, and a decode failure after the first array
    has parsed ends the scan rather than the review, because trailing prose is
    drift and not a reason to throw away findings already in hand. Only the
    first array failing to parse is fatal — at that point there is nothing to
    post and nothing to infer.

    The LAST fenced block wins, not the first. The prompt now asks the
    reviewer to work through the diff in plain text before answering, because
    a model told to emit nothing but JSON does no reasoning and finds
    correspondingly little. That scan quotes diff rows and sometimes brackets
    them, so the first fenced array in the response is no longer reliably the
    answer — the prompt says the findings block comes last, and this reads it
    from the same end.

    A block that will not parse AT ALL is repaired, and failing that salvaged
    finding by finding, rather than thrown away whole. Findings quote source
    verbatim in `window`, and source is full of double quotes: a reviewer
    emitted

        "window": "  211:     assert res["success"] is True\\n ..."

    which is one unescaped pair away from valid and killed an entire review
    of three good findings.

    Repair runs first because it recovers the WHOLE block, where salvage keeps
    only the findings that happened to be well-formed already. Salvage alone
    is not enough: the same quoting habit corrupts every window drawn from the
    same file, so on a quote-dense diff there are no well-formed siblings left
    to keep. Repair declines anything it cannot read one single way, so salvage

    which is not JSON. `_salvage_findings` cannot help: it drops a finding it
    cannot decode, and one quoting habit corrupts EVERY window drawn from the
    same file, so a quote-dense diff loses the whole review rather than one
    finding of it. That is what happened on #2566, where both findings quoted
    shell out of a workflow file and the run died as a CI fault.

    Escaping alone is not enough, because where a value ENDS can be genuinely
    ambiguous. A window that quotes findings-shaped source — which this repo's
