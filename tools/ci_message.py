"""
One shared way to tell a contributor what went wrong.

Every user-facing CI failure in this repo is a :class:`Diagnostic`. The
class exists to make one specific failure mode impossible: a message that
says WHAT is wrong and stops there, leaving the contributor to reverse
engineer the rule from `.github/policy.yml`.

A Diagnostic must answer four questions, and the constructor rejects it if
any answer is missing:

    what   The problem, naming the exact file / field / value.
    why    Which rule fired, and why it applies to THIS recipe. Provenance,
           not restatement: "required because manifest.language is 'python'"
           rather than "this file is required".
    how    The concrete fix. A command to run, or the exact text to add.
           May be multi-line; formatting survives to both renderers.
    doc    Anchor into docs/recipe-handbook/troubleshooting.md, so there is
           always somewhere to go for more than one line of context.

The acid test each message must pass: *could a contributor who has never
opened policy.yml fix this in one attempt, without asking anyone?*

Two renderers, one Diagnostic:

    render_human()       Multi-line block for the job log, where there is
                         room to breathe.
    render_annotation()  A single ``::error`` line for the PR Files tab.
                         Newlines are percent-encoded as ``%0A``, which is
                         GitHub's own escape — multi-line `how` blocks stay
                         multi-line in the annotation instead of being
                         flattened into one unusable line.

CONTRIBUTOR FAULT vs CI FAULT
-----------------------------
:class:`Diagnostic` is for things the contributor can fix. When one of our
own checkers crashes — bad TOML we failed to guard, a missing CI dep, a
network blip — use :func:`infra_fault` instead. It annotates the *checker*,
never the contributor's file, and says plainly that the failure is not
theirs. Putting a red marker on someone's `.env.example` because our TOML
parser raised AttributeError is how you teach people to ignore CI.

Import from anywhere
--------------------
Stdlib only, and no imports from other repo modules, so this is safe to
import from `.github/scripts/*` (which run under `uv run --no-project`
with no repo dependencies available) as well as from `tools/*`:

    import sys
    from pathlib import Path

    sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2] / "tools"))
