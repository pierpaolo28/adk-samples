Verify that changes to the .github/ directory are made only by repository admins.

Files under .github/ (CI workflows, issue templates, automation scripts, and
repository policy configuration) control repository-wide infrastructure and
security. Non-admin pull requests that touch any file under .github/ are
rejected with actionable diagnostic messages.

Reads changed file paths from stdin (one per line) or from --changed-files,
and inspects the PR author's repository permission level.

NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY
-----------------------
This is a guard rail, not enforcement. The workflow that runs it lives under
.github/ and is triggered by `pull_request`, so GitHub executes the PR's OWN
copy of it -- a contributor can edit or delete the check in the same pull
request that edits the rest of .github/. Read a green result as "nobody
tripped over the rule by accident", never as "nobody can change .github/".
What actually enforces this is GitHub-native and lives outside the tree:

    * a CODEOWNERS entry for `/.github/`, with required review from that team;
    * a repository or organization ruleset restricting those paths;
    * this job marked as a required status check, so DELETING it blocks the
      merge (a never-reported required check is not a pass) instead of
      quietly skipping the gate.

Usage:
    git -c core.quotePath=false diff --no-renames --name-only \\
        origin/main...HEAD | \\
        uv run --no-project python tools/check_github_dir_changes.py \\
            --author "<login>" \\
            --author-association "<association>" \\
            --repo "<owner>/<repo>"

Both git flags are load-bearing. With rename detection on (the default),
moving a file OUT of .github/ reports only the destination path, so the
deletion is invisible to this check. With `core.quotePath` on (the default),
a path containing non-ASCII bytes arrives C-quoted -- `".github/w\\303\\266rk.yml"`
-- whose first path component is `".github`, not `.github`.

Dependabot exemption: .github/dependabot.yml keeps the `github-actions`
ecosystem enabled, and those PRs can only ever touch workflow files. A PR
authored by `dependabot[bot]` whose .github/ changes all sit under
.github/workflows/ passes. The `[bot]` suffix is reserved for GitHub Apps, so
a human account cannot claim that login.

Exit codes:
    0  no .github/ changes, author is a repository administrator, or a
       Dependabot PR that only touches .github/workflows/
    1  unauthorized changes to .github/ by a non-admin
    2  CI fault -- including "could not determine whether the author is an
       administrator". That still fails closed, but it is reported as our
       problem rather than as an accusation against the contributor.
