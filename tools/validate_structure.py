#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Validates the structural shell of every recipe under core/ and contrib/
(and plugins/) — the checks that are determined by folder
location and the recipe's declared language, NOT by anything language-
specific.

Checks performed, in order, for each recipe:
  1. manifest.yaml presence.
  2. manifest.yaml schema (delegated to validate_manifest).
  3. Folder name matches ^[a-z][a-z-]*$ and length <= policy limit.
  4. Folder size (bytes) and file count vs .github/policy.yml tiers
     (core vs contrib, default vs manifest.large=true), applying
     excluded_paths as a union across every language section.
  5. Required files present — the UNION of policy.required_files.always,
     policy.required_files.by_root[<root>], and
     policy.required_files.by_language[<manifest.language>].
     manifest.yaml itself is NOT listed in policy.required_files; check 1
     is authoritative for it, and duplicating the rule would double-report.
  6. Required directories present — the same three-way union over
     policy.required_dirs. Vertical plugins use this for scripts/.
     An empty directory passes.

Name matching for checks 5 and 6 is done in Python rather than by asking
the filesystem, so a case-mismatched file fails identically on macOS and
on Linux CI. Entries listed in policy.case_insensitive_files may be
spelled in any case and report an advisory note instead.

Language detection: manifest.language is the ONLY source of truth. Path
convention (e.g. core/python/foo/) carries no meaning to this checker.
When manifest.yaml is missing, checks 2 and the language-derived slice of
check 5 are skipped for that recipe — the maintainer still sees the
folder-name, size, and always/by_root file-requirement failures in the
same run, so they can fix everything in one shot.

Usage:
  # Validate all recipes (both core/ and contrib/):
  uv run validate structure
  uv run validate structure all

  # Validate only core/ or contrib/:
  uv run validate structure core
  uv run validate structure contrib

  # Validate a single recipe:
  uv run validate structure core/rag-agent-search
  uv run validate structure core/python/some-recipe

Exit codes:
  0 — every checked recipe passed every applicable check
  1 — one or more recipes failed one or more checks
