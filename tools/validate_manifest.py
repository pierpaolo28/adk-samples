#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Validates manifest.yaml files in recipe directories under core/ and contrib/.

Checks:
  - Every recipe directory has a manifest.yaml file.
  - Every manifest.yaml is valid YAML.
  - Every manifest.yaml conforms to the schema at
    .github/schemas/manifest-schema.json.
  - ownership.team and ownership.poc are not left as placeholder values.

Usage:
  # Validate all recipes (both core/ and contrib/):
  python3 tools/validate_manifest.py
  python3 tools/validate_manifest.py all

  # Validate only core/ or contrib/:
  python3 tools/validate_manifest.py core
  python3 tools/validate_manifest.py contrib

  # Validate a single recipe:
  python3 tools/validate_manifest.py core/rag-agent-search

  Dependencies are managed in pyproject.toml. Run `uv sync` once before using.

Exit codes:
  0 — all manifests present and valid
  1 — one or more manifests missing or invalid
