# Java Recipes

Not currently active. No Java recipes have landed yet and no
language-specific tooling (skills, CI, `pyproject`-equivalent
checks) is in place.

**If you want to contribute one:** open a GitHub issue at
[github.com/google/adk-recipes/issues](https://github.com/google/adk-recipes/issues)
first so we can align on package manager, test runner, and file
layout before you invest the work. Once accepted, this page will
mirror the shape of the [Python page](./python.md).

Structural checks apply to Java recipes today: every recipe must include
`manifest.yaml`, `README.md`, `.env.example`, and one build configuration
file (`pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, or `build.gradle.kts` — both Maven
and Gradle are supported). No lockfile is required (Maven has no
lockfile concept, and Gradle dependency locking is not used). You can
submit a working `contrib/java/` recipe against those alone.
