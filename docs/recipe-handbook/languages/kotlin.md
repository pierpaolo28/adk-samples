# Kotlin Recipes

`core/kotlin/llm-auditor` is the first Kotlin recipe. There are no
Kotlin authoring skills or `pyproject`-equivalent checks yet.

**If you want to contribute one:** open a GitHub issue at
[github.com/google/adk-recipes/issues](https://github.com/google/adk-recipes/issues)
first so we can align on build tool (Gradle / Maven), test
runner, and JVM target before you invest the work. Once accepted,
this page will mirror the shape of the [Python page](./python.md).

Structural checks apply to Kotlin recipes today: every recipe must include
`manifest.yaml`, `README.md`, `.env.example`, and `build.gradle.kts`.
No lockfile is required (Gradle dependency locking is not used). You
can submit a working `contrib/kotlin/` recipe against those alone.
